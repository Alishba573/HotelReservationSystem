# Hotel Reservation System - Software Construction CCP

## Project Overview
This is a hotel room reservation system implemented in Java as part of the Complex Computing Problem (CCP) for Software Construction course.

## Domain Classes Implemented (Day 1)
- `Hotel` - Represents a hotel with rooms
- `Room` - Represents individual hotel rooms
- `Customer` - Stores customer information
- `Booking` - Manages room bookings

## Technology Stack
- Object-Oriented Design Principles
- Defensive Programming
- JUnit 5 (to be added)

## Day 1 Progress
✓ Created all domain classes
✓ Implemented basic attributes and methods
✓ Added input validation
✓ Set up Git repository

 Use Cases Demonstrated
1. **Hotel Creation** - Initialize hotel with name and location
2. **Room Management** - Add different room types with pricing
3. **Customer Registration** - Create and store customer profiles
4. **Availability Checking** - Find available rooms dynamically
5. **Room Booking** - Reserve rooms with date validation
6. **Double Booking Prevention** - System prevents overlapping bookings
7. **Defensive Programming** - Shows error handling for invalid inputs

## Testing Strategy
- **AAA Pattern** - All tests follow Arrange-Act-Assert
- **Parameterized Tests** - Test multiple input values (e.g., invalid room numbers)
- **Boundary Testing** - Edge cases and invalid inputs
- **100% Test Pass Rate** - All unit tests pass successfully

## Commit History
1. **Day 1**: Created domain classes (Hotel, Room, Customer, Booking)
2. **Day 2**: Added comprehensive unit tests with JUnit 5
3. **Day 3**: Implemented Main.java demonstration program
4. **Day 3**: Updated documentation and README
5. **Day 3**: Final code cleanup and submission

## To Run:
1. Clone repository: `git clone https://github.com/Alishba573/HotelReservationSystem.git`
2. Open in Eclipse/IntelliJ
3. Run Main.java (to be added)
